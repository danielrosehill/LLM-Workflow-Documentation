# Published

My documentation now enjoys a colorful dual purpose life, existing both as Github repositories and on a new dedicated site to hosting docs (oh howI love my docs!): [https://docs.bydanielrosehill.com](docs.bydanielrosehill.com).

## Purpose Statement

This repository (created `20-Nov-24`) is an updated repository template for managing workflow and operations with large language models (ie, 'LLM-Ops'), focusing (again) on providing a structured skeleton intended to support the needs (primarily) of those using LLMs professionally and at scale.

Some folks who tend to use these tools "on the job" and who are share my fondness for approaching workflows like this systematically include:

- Data scientists  
- Researchers  
- LLM enthusiasts and geeks (this is not intended as a derogatory; I self-identify as one!)

To state the obvious:

Like most users I imagine, my own processes for working with LLMs are in a constant state of evolution and flux, much as the technology itself is. 

But although six months have passed since I began using LLMs professionally, a few constants have remained: I'm diligent about recording prompts, outputs, contextual data, and agent configurations and continue to see these as the building blocks for developing process with LLMs.

Therefore, like most of my repos, this is just another open source documentation of (another) step along the road. It will hopefully be succeeded by better
