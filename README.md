My documentation now enjoys a colorful dual purpose life, existing both as Github repositories and on a new dedicated site to hosting docs (oh howI love my docs!): [https://docs.bydanielrosehill.com](docs.bydanielrosehill.com).

## Purpose Statement

This repository (created `20-Nov-24`) is a repository of documentation for working with large language models focusing (again) on providing a structured skeleton intended to support the needs (primarily) of those using LLMs professionally and at scale.

Some folks who tend to use these tools "on the job" and who are share my fondness for approaching workflows like this systematically include:

- Data scientists  
- Researchers  
- LLM enthusiasts and geeks (this is not intended as a derogatory; I self-identify as one!)

To state the obvious:

Like most users I imagine, my own processes for working with LLMs are in a constant state of evolution and flux, much as the technology itself is. Therefore, I will endeavor to update these documents periodically as my thoughts and processes continue to reshape and, eventually, find expression.
